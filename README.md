# Distribution-Explorer

With this tool you can explore the shapes of different distributions and the
meaning of their parameters.

On the left-hand side of the screen is a panel that allows control of the
type, number and parameters of up to three probability distributions. The upper
three sliders control the limits of the graph axes. The radio buttons below that
control the number of distributions to be plotted at once. Below that are
controls for the type and parameters of each distribution. It may be necessary
to scroll down to see all of the controls.

On the right-hand side of the screen the current choices are plotted, x against
the probability density of x. The first distribution is plotted in red, the
second in green, and the third in blue.
